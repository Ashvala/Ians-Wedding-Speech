Hi everyone, my name is Ash. I'm one of Ian's friends and, at one point, his bandmate in Merge Conflict. I'm beyond honored that Ian and Emma asked me to share a few words today. In keeping with tradition, I promise to keep this brief so we can get to the festivities as soon as possible.

In true Ian fashion, I've uploaded this speech to GitHub—so feel free to create a pull request. There's also a QR code you can scan if you'd like to check it out. And if you get a chance, ask Ian about scorecards—he might just pull out a receipt printer and hand you a QR code that makes music instead of leading to this speech.

Ian, you are my best friend. It's impossible to find someone with your boundless energy, creativity, and joy. Your love for KRAZAM videos and pretending to be Invoker from Dota2 will, hopefully, never change. I’m always amazed by the wild ideas you come up with, and how the next day, I see them in action. You, are a force of nature my friend.

Emma, I've known you for about as long as I've known Ian, and from the first time I saw you two together, I knew you were meant for each other. The love and support you share is something truly special. I can always tell when you're away at a conference because Ian just isn’t quite complete without you. You two complete each other.

As we celebrate your union today, it's clear how much both of you mean to all of us—as family, friends, mentors, creative partners, or simply as incredible people to be around. So, I'd like to raise a toast to the most wonderful couple I know. To Ian and Emma: may every day be filled with even more joy, adventure, and love. Here's to a long and happy life together. Cheers!
